# Trybe Futebol Clube

## About
Project developed at Back-End Development Module of Trybe's Web Development course. It was approved with 100% of the mandatory and optional requirements met.

The goal was to develop a RESTful API following SOLID principles, and its integration tests for a front-end application that was already developed.

The application is used to check matches's data and the leaderboard of a soccer competition, to register and update matches. 
The authentication is handled with JSON Web Tokens, and the password encryption is handled with _bcryptjs_. 

The project is structured in four parts: 
- Database
- Back-End
- Fron-End
- Docker

## Tools
- TypeScript
- Node.js
- Express.js
- Sequelize.js
- Joi
- MySQL
- _bcryptjs_
- Mocha.js
- Chai.js
- Sinon.js
- OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)
- Docker
- React

## Developed Skills
- Use Object-Oriented Programming concepts

### In works
As of now, I am no longer working on this project.

#### PS: 
My computer can't run Docker, so I had to test it through GitHub -- that's why there are a lot of "_testing_" commits.
